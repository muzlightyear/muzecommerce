This is an e-commerce site I made in around 2 days after learning how to use Javascript, HTML & CSS in unison for some interesting effects. 
This site was designed to be a barebones project to teach myself how to do a couple of things I was curious about; passing form data to visible UI & uploading images to a site.

I intend to remake this in the future using React as I believe React is very well equipped for dealing with projects like this & passing props between components & using react-router-dom for links feels much more efficient than what I did here.
